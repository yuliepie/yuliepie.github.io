title: Week 4, October
---

I've decided to write down weekly goals and do a weekly retrospective to assess my progress. This is in the hope that it will materialize my goals and progress externally, instead of keeping them all inside me.   

약간은 지친 내게 새로운 활력소가 되어주길 희망을 가져본다 🌟.

### 🌵 This week's goals
---
☑️ ```엘리스 머신러닝 진도 따라잡기```
   
☑️ ```매일 10분 이상 운동하기```

Let's start small, and see how it goes. Looking forward to end-of-week review!
